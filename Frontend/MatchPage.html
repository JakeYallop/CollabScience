            <h3>NASA BPS Open Science Data Repository</h3>
            <div class="scrollable-content">
                <p>The NASA Open Science Data Repository consists of two integrated biological databases—Ames Life Sciences Data Archive (ALSDA) and GeneLab—into one centralized data system. The Ames Life Sciences Data Archive (ALSDA) is the official repository of non-human science data spanning a broad range of biological levels involving data from tissues, organs, whole organisms, physiology, and behavior. GeneLab is an open science multi-omics repository hosting transcriptomics, metagenomics, epigenomics, proteomics, and metabolomics data. Studies comprise of data from model organisms including microbes, plants, fruit flies, rodents and humans. This database enables the accessibility, interoperability, and reusability of biological data from space-related experiments.</p>

            <h3>GeneLab: Open Science for Exploration</h3>
           
            <p>GeneLab expands scientists’ access to the research conducted in microgravity with experiments that explore the molecular response of biology to spaceflight environment. The vast amounts of raw data generated by experiments aboard the International Space Station are available to a worldwide community of scientists and computational researchers in an open access database. </p>

            <h3>Life Sciences Data Archive (LSDA)</h3>
            <div class="scrollable-content">
            <p> The LSDA is a publicly accessible active archive of data from NASA-funded spaceflight, flight analog and ground-based life sciences research investigations. Basic descriptions of the individual investigations are provided, and data collected from these investigations (when available) are stored in primarily file-based formats (e.g. spreadsheet, text, and image formats). Non-attributable data for many of these investigations can be downloaded directly from the website. However, sensitive or attributable data must be requested via the Data Request Portal. New or updated information is continually added to the archive.  </p>

            <p>The Physical Science Informatics (PSI) data repository is the archive for physical science experiments performed on the International Space Station (ISS) and Space Transportation System (STS, or space shuttle). The PSI system is accessible and open to the public, and is a resource for researchers to data mine the PSI system and expand upon the valuable research performed by NASA in space, using it as a research tool to further science, while also fulfilling the President’s Open Data Policy. </p>

            <h3>Materials In Space</h3>
            <div class="scrollable-content">
            <p>Materials used on the exterior of spacecraft, satellites and space stations in low-Earth orbit are subjected to many environmental threats that can cause degradation. Space environments affect flight experiments and test the stability and durability of materials and devices in the space environment. The goal of this site is to provide single-point access to the data and analysis from research into materials in space. Data are stored in NASA’s Materials And Processes Technical Information System (MAPTIS). </p>
