          <h3>NASA BPS Open Science Data Repository</h3>
          <div class="scrollable-content">
            <p>
              The NASA Open Science Data Repository consists of two integrated
              biological databases—Ames Life Sciences Data Archive (ALSDA) and
              GeneLab—into one centralized data system. The Ames Life Sciences
              Data Archive (ALSDA) is the official repository of non-human
              science data spanning a broad range of biological levels involving
              data from tissues, organs, whole organisms, physiology, and
              behavior. GeneLab is an open science multi-omics repository
              hosting transcriptomics, metagenomics, epigenomics, proteomics,
              and metabolomics data. Studies comprise of data from model
              organisms including microbes, plants, fruit flies, rodents and
              humans. This database enables the accessibility, interoperability,
              and reusability of biological data from space-related experiments.

          <h3>GeneLab: Open Science for Exploration</h3>

          <p>
            GeneLab expands scientists’ access to the research conducted in
            microgravity with experiments that explore the molecular response of
            biology to spaceflight environment. The vast amounts of raw data
            generated by experiments aboard the International Space Station are
            available to a worldwide community of scientists and computational
            researchers in an open access database.

          <h3>Life Sciences Data Archive (LSDA)</h3>
          <div class="scrollable-content">
            <p>
              The LSDA is a publicly accessible active archive of data from
              NASA-funded spaceflight, flight analog and ground-based life
              sciences research investigations. Basic descriptions of the
              individual investigations are provided, and data collected from
              these investigations (when available) are stored in primarily
              file-based formats (e.g. spreadsheet, text, and image formats).
              Non-attributable data for many of these investigations can be
              downloaded directly from the website. However, sensitive or
              attributable data must be requested via the Data Request Portal.
              New or updated information is continually added to the archive.

          <h3>Physical Science Informatics (PSI)</h3>
          <div class="scrollable-content">
            <p>
              The Physical Science Informatics (PSI) data repository is the
              archive for physical science experiments performed on the
              International Space Station (ISS) and Space Transportation System
              (STS, or space shuttle). The PSI system is accessible and open to
              the public, and is a resource for researchers to data mine the PSI
              system and expand upon the valuable research performed by NASA in
              space, using it as a research tool to further science, while also
              fulfilling the President’s Open Data Policy.

          <h3>Materials In Space</h3>
          <div class="scrollable-content">
            <p>
              Materials used on the exterior of spacecraft, satellites and space
              stations in low-Earth orbit are subjected to many environmental
              threats that can cause degradation. Space environments affect
              flight experiments and test the stability and durability of
              materials and devices in the space environment. The goal of this
              site is to provide single-point access to the data and analysis
              from research into materials in space. Data are stored in NASA’s
              Materials And Processes Technical Information System (MAPTIS).
