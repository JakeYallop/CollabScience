# CollabScience

CollabScience helps you find the science projects that matter to you, rather than spending all your time reviewing lists of open science projects you can now find a project to contribute to in minutes! What we innovated is  a 'Swipe & Match' feature, where users can swipe through projects and, upon a match, connect with those that align with their expertise and interests. 

CollabScience was developed for the [2023 NASA International Space Apps Challenge](https://www.spaceappschallenge.org/2023/challenges/a-marketplace-for-open-science-projects/) a two day hackathon to come up with innovate ideas inspired by and using NASA data.

## Quick Start Guide
Navigate through the CollabScience codebase and get it running in a few simple steps:
1. **Clone the Code**: Dive into the innovative codebase.
2. **Launch the Project**: Open in Visual Studio with a double-click on `CollabScience.sln`.
3. **Run**: Hit the run button in Visual Studio and confirm any ensuing HTTPS dialogs.

## Technologies: Harnessing Modern Tech Power
- **C# .NET 7 (ASP.NET Core)**: Utilizing the potent capabilities of the latest .NET technology for a robust backend.
- **TypeScript**: Facilitating type-safe, scalable, and maintainable front-end development.
- **Azure with GitHub Actions CI**: Employing cloud technology and continuous integration for seamless deployment and management.

## Deployment: Your Gateway to Collaboration
Engage with CollabScience and initiate your innovative journey directly via: [CollabScience.Earth](https://collabscience.earth/).

## Potential Extensions: Expanding Horizons
1. **Submission Dynamics**: Integrate a user-friendly submission page and process, enabling a smooth introduction of new projects to the platform.
2. **User Ecosystem**: Enhance user interaction and personalization with a feature-rich system for sign-up, login, and user profile management.
3. **Interactive Communications**: Build a communication conduit between project maintainers and potential contributors to foster a seamless exchange of ideas and collaborative spirit.
